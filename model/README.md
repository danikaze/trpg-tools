# Model

The model defines the data interfaces, both used data in the app, or stored data in the database.

Data in the [sql](./sql) folder defines low level implementation of the database, in this case using SQL via the [MySql](../utils/mysql.ts) wrapper.

Rest of the files/folders inside `model` refers to the logic data of the application.
